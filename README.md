# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

## Overview
UTE is a HTTP traffic simulator template project for simulating interactions with your REST endpoints. It provides an out of the box sandbox to get you quickly up and running with testing.

UTE-visor is a management system for controlling your UTE instances. It's a handy web based dashboard that will give you control over your UTE nodes and pull back the current running status on all of them.
